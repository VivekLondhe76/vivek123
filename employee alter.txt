Step 1: Create Tables with Primary and Foreign Keys

-- Create employee table
CREATE TABLE employee (
    eid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ename VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Create assignment table
CREATE TABLE assignment (
    projectid INT,
    eid INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (projectid, eid),
    FOREIGN KEY (projectid) REFERENCES project(projectid),
    FOREIGN KEY (eid) REFERENCES employee(eid)
);

-- Create project table
CREATE TABLE project (
    projectid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    project_name VARCHAR(100),
    manager INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (manager) REFERENCES manager(eid)
);

-- Create manager table
CREATE TABLE manager (
    eid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ename VARCHAR(50)
);
Step 2: Alter employee Table to Add address

ALTER TABLE employee ADD address VARCHAR(100);
Step 3: Queries
i) Display employee names and projects they are working on

SELECT e.ename, p.project_name 
FROM employee e
JOIN assignment a ON e.eid = a.eid
JOIN project p ON a.projectid = p.projectid;
ii) Display projectid, project_name, and their managers

SELECT p.projectid, p.project_name, m.ename AS manager_name
FROM project p
JOIN manager m ON p.manager = m.eid;
iii) Create a view of employees working on the 'Bank Management' project


CREATE VIEW employees_on_bank_management AS
SELECT e.eid, e.ename, e.salary
FROM employee e
JOIN assignment a ON e.eid = a.eid
JOIN project p ON a.projectid = p.projectid
WHERE p.project_name = 'Bank Management';

iv) Print names of employees whose salary is greater than 40000

SELECT ename 
FROM employee
WHERE salary > 40000;
v) Update the salary of each employee with an increase of Rs. 2000

UPDATE employee
SET salary = salary + 2000;
